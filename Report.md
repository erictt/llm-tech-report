# [Draft] An Early Dive into LLMs

Written by Eric Yang

## Introduction

Large Language Models(LLMs) has become an increasingly hot topic since the release of ChatGPT by OpenAI. These models have demonstrated remarkable capabilities in various natural language understanding tasks, making them a hot topic in the field of artificial intelligence. We believe that embracing this innovation, and integrating it into our products will not only offer invaluable features to our customers, but also elevate us to a leading position among our competitors.

As the Pipe Jumpers team, we have taken the initiative to explore the potentialities of LLMs and their transformative power within various areas. Over the course of two months, we have dedicated our efforts to research, experimentation, and the creation of [a proof-of-concept demo](https://poc-common-ai.lightspeedsbx.app/) that demonstrates the capabilities of LLMs. Our most recent endeavor focuses on the [AI-powered conversational search](https://ai-search.lightspeedsbx.app/analytics) project, in collaboration with our analytics team, which has successfully progressed to its alpha phase. Notably, even at this early stage, it has already yielded impressive results.

This report aims to provide a high-level understanding of AI and LLMs, and their implications for product development. We begin with an introduction of AI, followed by an in-depth analysis of the technology that drives LLM-based products. We then focus on our AI-powered conversational search system, examining its functionality, the challenges we faced, and potential enhancements. Finally, we'll illuminate the opportunities that LLMs present for Lightspeed to explore and leverage.

## Background
<!-- ## The Fundamentals of AI in LLM-Driven Products -->

>"It seems probable that once the machine thinking method had started, it would not take long to outstrip our feeble powers. ... At some stage therefore we should have to expect the machines to take control." - Alan Turing, 1951

As we stand on the threshold of a new era, Alan Turing's visionary statement echoes through the annals of artificial intelligence. Today, machines have transitioned from being mere tools to becoming intelligent collaborators. They now possess capabilities to understand complex instructions, generate insightful reports, and even engage in human-like dialogue.

Large Language Models (LLMs) are central to this transformative journey. These AI models are capable of understanding and generating human language, thereby propelling a new wave of applications and services. From customer service chatbots to AI writing assistants, LLMs are redefining our perception of technology's potential. Turing's vision invites us to not only marvel at these advancements but also contemplate the implications and responsibilities that come with increasingly intelligent machines.

Artificial intelligence (AI) is a branch of computer science that aims to create systems capable of performing tasks that normally require human intelligence, such as understanding natural language, recognizing patterns, make decisions. It began in 1950 with Alan Turing's proposal of the Turing Test, a measurement to determine if a computer can demonstrate the same intelligence as a human.
- https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Timeline_of_artificial_intelligence

Machine Learning (ML) is a subset of AI that employs statistical learning and optimization techniques to enable computers to analyze data, identify patterns, and make predictions or decisions. A typical ML algorithm comprises a *decision process* that guesses patterns in the data, an *error function* to measure the accuracy of these guesses against known examples, and an *updating process* that refines the decision-making to improve future predictions.

To illustrate the difference between traditional programming and ML, imagine we are trying to predict customer churn for an online store. With traditional programming, we might create rules based on observed patterns, such as predicting that a customer will churn if they haven't made a purchase in six months. This rule-based system is easy to understand and implement but is limited by the complexity of human behavior.

On the other hand, an ML approach would involve providing a model with numerous examples of customers who have and haven't churned, along with relevant details about each customer (e.g., purchase frequency, product preferences, feedback). The ML model learns the characteristics associated with customer churn directly from the data, which allows it to consider a broader range of factors than a simple rule-based system.

Deep Learning (DL) is an advanced form of ML that can handle more complex patterns and automatically determine which features are important. Unlike standard ML techniques, which often require explicit feature engineering, deep learning models are adept at automatically learning and extracting useful features from raw data.

Returning to our churn prediction example. With DL, instead of providing the model with preselected customer details, we could input a customer's full purchase history. The DL model can then analyze this raw data, learning to recognize intricate patterns and important features that indicate customer churn. While more complex, this approach allows for a nuanced understanding of customer behavior, potentially leading to more accurate churn predictions.

### Natural Language Processing (NLP) and Language Models(LMs)

This transformative journey of machines becoming conversational partners is made possible by a field of AI known as Natural Language Processing (NLP). NLP focuses on the intricate interaction between computers and human language, aiming to enable computers to comprehend, interpret, and generate language that is contextually meaningful and valuable.

A core component of NLP is the development and use of language models. These are AI models trained on vast repositories of text data, which enable them to learn and internalize the statistical patterns and relationships between words and phrases. By predicting the likelihood of a given sequence of words appearing in a text, language models are capable of generating text that is strikingly human-like.

Over the years, two primary training approaches have emerged in the realm of language models. The first involves training a model to specialize in a specific task, such as machine translation. While this can yield high performance for that task, it may limit the model's capacity to generalize to other tasks.

In contrast, the second approach focuses on training a model to be proficient across an array of tasks. Here, a general-purpose model is trained on a large corpus of text and then fine-tuned for specific tasks as needed, yielding a more versatile model that performs well across a broad spectrum of tasks. In recent years, we've observed that general-purpose models often struggle to match the performance of task-specific models. But this might not hold truth for long.

Earlier this year, Tencent conducted an experiment to evaluate ChatGPT's performance on machine translation[^1]. They found that although ChatGPT couldn't quite match the performance of established translation tools like Google Translate and DeepL, it was not far behind, particularly the GPT-4 variant.

- Source: Is ChatGPT A Good Translator? Yes With GPT-4 As The Engine[^1]

Building on this, a team from Microsoft undertook a thorough experiment to assess the same task. Their results aligned with Tencent's findings, but with an interesting twist. They delved deeper to understand why GPT scored lower on various evaluations. They found that LLMs tend to be more paraphrastic and expand world knowledge, which isn't necessarily rewarded by existing evaluation metrics (some examples are provided below)[^2]. This led them to the conclusion that improved metrics are needed to avoid misrepresenting the quality of translations.

### The Era of General-Purpose LLMs

![](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/erictt/llm-tech-report/main/assets/report-50.png)

Ever since the revolutionary paper "Attention Is All You Need[^3]" was unveiled in 2017, the landscape of NLP models has drastically shifted towards the Transformer architecture. This structure quickly became the bedrock for a majority of Large Language Models (LLMs), including pivotal models such as BERT[^4] and GPT[^5]. Additionally, the size of these models has been progressively expanding. As of now, GPT-4[^6] is likely the largest language model which has more than 1 trillion parameters. Although its exact size hasn't been disclosed by OpenAI, leaving room for speculation.

Why do language models increase in size rapidly? This question can be answered by examining the relationship between model size and performance. Research indicates that the performance of language models consistently improves as we upscale the model size, dataset size, and the computational resources allocated for training[^7]. One fascinating aspect of this scale-up process is the emergence of new abilities in larger models, abilities that smaller models don't possess. This is referred to as "emergence"[^8]. A prime example is the significant enhancement seen in the performance of large models during few-shot learning tasks. In these tasks, the models are provided with a small number of examples and are asked to make predictions based on that limited data.

Moreover, emergence doesn't just relate to task performance, it also applies to new prompting strategies which only start to outperform traditional approaches once a certain model size is achieved. In the paper "*Emergent Abilities of Large Language Models*"[^8], this phenomenon are illustrated through eight distinct NLP tasks(see below graph). In the corresponding plots, you can see that initially, the language model's performance appears random, but as the scale increases, clear emergent abilities begin to surface.

- ![](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/erictt/llm-tech-report/main/assets/report-51.png)
However, it's important to note that there's no formal definition for what constitutes a "large" language model, and the scale at which a model begins to exhibit emergent abilities can vary. This variability underscores the complexity and adaptability of large language models, providing further impetus for their continued exploration and development.

A key challenge arises when observing that a model doesn't instantly acquire the capability to produce the correct answer, aka the emergent ability. Rather, it incrementally gets closer to the right answer with each step, and the final correct response only comes more often once the model has reached a particular size. However, it's crucial to note that the accuracy of the reasoning process leading to the final correct answer was not evaluated in the paper.(can't find the paper)

### LLMs in Comparison

As of May 30th, 2023, a variety of LLMs have garnered significant attention. The following table provides a comparative overview of some popular models:

- This is not a complete list of all of LLMs. Models like Chinchilla, PaLM, and LLaMA, among others, have been omitted. This exclusion may be due to various reasons, including: 1. the fact that there are more recent updated models; 2. their proprietary nature or unavailability in open-source form; and 3. the existence of other models that provide similar performance but with a smaller size.
- The quality serves as a reference point only, as the performance of the model can differ depending on the specific task. To learn more about elo rating system, please refer to this blog: <https://lmsys.org/blog/2023-05-03-arena/>

GPT-4 by OpenAI remains the top-performing model in the market, and it appears set to maintain this position for some time. However, the AI landscape is highly dynamic, with newcomers like Google's PaLM 2 already showing promising results and being integrated into various Google products[^9].

While these high-performing models grab the headlines, there is a vibrant and innovative open-source community contributing to the advancement of LLMs. The community is making significant strides, as highlighted by the work on Alpaca[^10], Vicuna[^11].

The success of these projects underscores the truth in the phrase "less is more," a concept brilliantly demonstrated in the paper "Less Is More for Alignment"[^12] These models have shown that the quality of training data often outweighs the quantity. For instance, LiMA was trained on just 1000 examples(details below) using the LLaMA 65B model[^12] but managed to outperform Alpaca, which was trained with 52K instructing-following examples[^10].

- ![](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/erictt/llm-tech-report/main/assets/report-52.png)
  - Source: LiMA: Less Is More for Alignment[^12]

This revelation provides a valuable insight for the development of future large language models: a customized, high-quality dataset may be more beneficial than simply having a large volume of data. The impressive performance of models like Alpaca, Vicuna, and LIMA is a testament to this.

GPT4All-J[^13] and Dolly[^14], despite being the least performing models, are noteworthy for providing access to LLMs under the Apache 2.0 license, making them accessible in commercial use. Despite their current performance limitations, there is potential in these models as foundational technologies for future advancements in the AI field. Additionally, RedPajama released a dataset consisting of 1.2 trillion tokens[^15], bringing further improvement within reach.

## Augment Language Model

LLMs excel at tasks such as basic reasoning, interpreting code, and following instructions. However, they often fall short in areas such as multi-step reasoning, using external tools, and understanding domain-specific knowledge. Additionally, their performance may not be optimal if they are used as all-purpose models without any specific fine-tuning. In the following sections, we will explore recent studies and experiments that provide more insight into these issues.

### Unleash the Potential

To enhance the capabilities of Large Language Models (LLMs), we primarily focus on two strategies: **in-context learning** and **fine-tuning**.

In-context learning is a method that leverages the knowledge already present in a pre-trained model to perform a specific task without additional training. This is achieved by providing a well-designed instruction and/or context to the model, which guides it to generate the desired output based on its existing knowledge.[^16] In-context learning has shown impressive results in various tasks, such as program synthesis, arithmetic, and symbolic reasoning. However, it is often limited by the model's ability to generalize to new or more complex tasks, and it is not universally applicable to all NLP tasks.

Fine-tuning, on the other hand, is a process of adapting a pre-trained LLM to a specific task by training it further on a smaller, task-specific dataset. This allows the model to specialize in the target task and improve its performance. Fine-tuning has been used to enhance LLMs' performance in various domains, such as code synthesis, text-to-SQL[^17] capabilities, and conversational recommendation. By fine-tuning on a reserved segment of the dataset, performance can be improved on a specific task, although it may underperform on others.

#### In-context learning

To understand in-context learning, let's consider an interaction with GPT-3:

```
Q: A juggler can juggle 16 balls. Half of the balls are golf balls, and half of the golf balls are blue. How many blue golf balls are there?

A: The answer (arabic numerals) is
(Output) 8
```

- Example is from the paper: Large Language Models are Zero-Shot Reasoners[^16]

In this dialogue, the question is asked without any prior context or instructions. Unsurprisingly, GPT-3's response is inaccurate. This type of questioning, without any preparatory context, is known as the **zero-shot** approach.

An alternate method to improve response accuracy is the **few-shot** approach, where we establish a context with examples before asking the question:

```
Q: Roger has 5 tennis balls. He buys 2 more cans of tennis balls. Each can has 3 tennis balls. How many tennis balls does he have now?

A: The answer is 11.

Q: A juggler can juggle 16 balls. Half of the balls are golf balls, and half of the golf balls are blue. How many blue golf balls are there?

A: (Output) The answer is 8.
```

Despite the additional context, GPT-3 continues to provide an incorrect answer. So how to solve it?

**Chain of Thought Prompting**

Language model often struggle with tasks, like we illustrated above, that requires deliberate thinking in multiple steps. Their ability in accomplishing such tasks remains less than satisfactory, and augmenting the model size doesn't considerably improve performance.

One strategy that has been proved works really well is called  **'Chain of Thought' (CoT)**  which mirrors human cognition by integrating the 'thinking process' within the prompt. Here is an example:

```
Q: Roger has 5 tennis balls. He buys 2 more cans of tennis balls. Each can has 3 tennis balls. How many tennis balls does he have now?

A: Roger started with 5 balls. 2 cans of 3 tennis balls each is 6 tennis balls. 5 + 6 = 11. The answer is 11.

Q: A juggler can juggle 16 balls. Half of the balls are golf balls, and half of the golf balls are blue. How many blue golf balls are there?

A:(Output) The juggler can juggle 16 balls. Half of the balls are golf balls. So there are 16 / 2 = 8 golf balls. Half of the golf balls are blue. So there are 8 / 2 = 4 blue golf balls. The answer is 4.
```

This strategy is demonstrated in the study *Chain-of-Thought Prompting Elicits Reasoning in Large Language Models*[^18], which significantly enhances large language models' (LLMs) ability to perform complex reasoning by generating intermediate reasoning steps. It results in a 40% performance improvement for PaLM on GSM8K tasks.

- ![](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/erictt/llm-tech-report/main/assets/report-53.png)
  - [GSM8K](https://github.com/openai/grade-school-math) consists of 8.5K high quality grade school math problems created by human problem writers. These problems take between 2 and 8 steps to solve, and solutions primarily involve performing a sequence of elementary calculations using basic arithmetic operations (+ - / \*) to reach the final answer.

However, it's important to note that CoT prompting isn't a universal performance enhancer. Another conclusion from the study showed that the model's problem-solving rate doesn't increase until the model size reaches a specific threshold. Intriguingly, it was discovered that CoT prompting can actually hamper the performance of smaller models.[^19]

![](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/erictt/llm-tech-report/main/assets/report-54.png)

- Source: Challenging [BIG-Bench Tasks](https://github.com/google/BIG-bench) and Whether Chain-of-Thought Can Solve Them[^19]
  - BIG-Bench tasks cover a wide range of categories, including traditional NLP tasks, logic, math, code, understanding the world, understanding humans, scientific and technical understanding, and others.

Previously, we implemented the few-shot CoT approach to resolve the ball problem. It raises the question: Can zero-shot CoT also be effective? Fascinatingly, merely introducing the phrase "Let's think step by step" can dramatically boost accuracy for the [multistep arithmetic problem](https://github.com/google/BIG-bench/tree/main/bigbench/benchmark_tasks/multistep_arithmetic) from 17.7% to 78.7%[^16]. Moreover, using the phrase "Let's work this out in a step by step way to be sure we have the right answer" can further increase accuracy to a striking 82.0%[^20]. However, without CoT reasoning, the model's performance either does not improve or only gradually increases as the model size expands.

When do you need Chain-of-Thought Prompting for ChatGPT? [link](https://arxiv.org/abs/2304.03262)

Does CoT Prompting works for ChatGPT? Interestingly, the answer is no. One plausible explanation for this is that ChatGPT has already undergone training on tasks incorporating CoT and has memorized the instructions. As a result, it implicitly adheres to the chain of thought, even in the absence of explicit CoT prompting.

**Least-to-Most Prompting**[^21]

Least-to-most prompting is proposed by the same author the paper of CoT. It teaches language models to solve a complex problem by decomposing it to a series of simpler subproblems. It consists of two sequential stages:

1. **Decomposition**. The prompt in this stage contains constant examples that demonstrate the decomposition, followed by the specific question to be decomposed.
2. **Subproblem solving**. The prompt in this stage consists of three parts: (1) constant examples demonstrating how subproblems are solved; (2) a potentially empty list of previously answered subquestions and generated solutions, and (3) the question to be answered next.
Here is an example:

![](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/erictt/llm-tech-report/main/assets/report-55.png)

The authors evaluated the performance of least-to-most prompting on three tasks: SCAN, DROP and GSM8K. They found that least-to-most prompting outperformed chain-of-thought prompting in both SCAN and DROP tasks. But in GSM8K task, the least-to-most prompting essentially improves chain-of-thought prompting in solving problems which need at least 5 steps to be solved(from 39.07% to 45.23%).

- ![](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/erictt/llm-tech-report/main/assets/report-58.png)
  - [SCAN](https://github.com/brendenlake/SCAN) consists of a set of commands and their corresponding action sequences. For example, command "look opposite right" is corresponding the action sequence: "TURN RIGHT TURN RIGHT LOOK".
  - [DROP](https://huggingface.co/datasets/drop) is a reading comprehension dataset that requires discrete reasoning over the content of paragraphs. For example, after reading a passage about a sports game, a question might be, "Who scored the most points?"

**Tree of Thought Prompting**[^22]

![](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/erictt/llm-tech-report/main/assets/report-59.png)

We previously discussed decomposing the tasks into intermediate steps in the Least-to-Most prompting. The Tree of Thought(ToT) prompting takes a further step. It not only decompose the problem to multiple steps but also maintain a tree of thoughts, where each thought is a state representing a partial solution with the input and the sequence of thoughts so far.

A specific instantiation of ToT involves answering four questions: 1) How to **decompose** the intermediate process into thought steps; 2) How to **generate** potential thoughts from each state; 3) How to heuristically **evaluate** states; 4) What **search** algorithm to use.

Take the task game of 24 as an example. ToT first ask LLM the possible next steps and then evaluates each thought candidate as "sure/maybe/impossible" with regard to reaching 24 in a BFS fashion. Each step, it only keeps the best five candidates. This approach allows for deliberate decision making by considering multiple different reasoning paths and self-evaluating choices to decide the next course of action, as well as looking ahead or backtracking when necessary to make global choices.

- ![](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/erictt/llm-tech-report/main/assets/report-60.png)
As a result, ToT achieved a higher success rate of 74%. CoT(best of 100) had a success rate of 49%, while Input-Output prompting(best of 100) had a lower success rate of 33%. Besides, the error analysis showed that CoT had the highest failure rate at the first step, with 60% of samples failing, while ToT (b=5) had the highest failure rate at the second step, with 47% of samples failing.
- ![](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/erictt/llm-tech-report/main/assets/report-61.png)
The experiments demonstrate that ToT significantly enhances language models' problem-solving abilities on three tasks requiring non-trivial planning or search: Game of 24, Creative Writing, and Crosswords. However, the evaluation involves specific prompts tailored to each task to achieve good performance, which highlights some limitations of the method. Nonetheless, the results are promising and suggest new ways of using language models for complex problem-solving. I believes that this paper represents a small step in a new direction where language models are mixed with programming and algorithms. Future studies are expected to improve the method and make it more automatic with less intervention required in the process.

The paper Rethinking the Role of Demonstrations: What Makes In-Context Learning Work? [link](https://arxiv.org/abs/2202.12837) proposed some interesting ideas such as
- the correctness of the examples in few-shot doesn't hurt the accuracy of the answer a lot.
	- ![](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/erictt/llm-tech-report/main/assets/report-43.png)
- you don't need to put lots of examples into the context, usually 4 is good start.
	- ![](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/erictt/llm-tech-report/main/assets/report-44.png)
- The reason that in-context learning work might be:
	1. **The input-label mapping**, i.e., whether each input $x_i$ is paired with a correct label $y_i$.
	2. **The distribution of the input text**, i.e., the underlying distribution that $x_1 ...x_k$ are from.
	3. **The label space**, i.e., the space covered by $y_1 ...y_k$.
	4. **The format**—specifically, the use of input-label pairing as the format.

The paper Larger language models do in-context learning differently[link](https://arxiv.org/abs/2303.03846) did a more comprehensive research and find that large models can override the prior knowledge from pretraining with input-label mappings presented in-context. Small model, on the other hand do not flip their predictions and thus are unable to override semantic priors.

#### Fine-tuning

**Full-parameter fine-tuning** and **efficient fine-tuning** are two approaches used to adapt large pre-trained language models (PLMs) to specific tasks or domains.

Full-parameter fine-tuning employs the pre-trained model as a starting point and trains it further with a new dataset. However, this approach demands substantial computational resources and may not be the most practical solution for many companies, particularly as models continue to grow in size. Moreover, it can be difficult to scale to multiple tasks, as it requires training separate instances of the model for each task.

A more prevalent approach, which is the one we're interested in, is efficient fine-tuning. It aims to address the limitations of full fine-tuning by adapting PLMs with fewer parameters and lower computational costs. Some common methods used to achieve this include adapters, which are small neural network modules that can be added to pre-trained models to improve their performance on specific tasks. Other methods include pruning, quantization, and distillation, which aim to reduce the number of parameters in a model without significantly affecting its performance. The results from the paper: *Exploring Efficient-tuning Methods in Self-supervised Speech Models*[^23] showed that adapters can achieve performance parity with over 90% parameter reduction compared to fine-tuning the entire model for each downstream task.

According to the paper *Exploring Efficient-tuning Methods in Self-supervised Speech Models*[^23], adapters can achieve performance parity with a whopping 90% parameter reduction compared to full-model fine-tuning for each downstream task.

The landscape of efficient fine-tuning has recently been enriched by initiatives such as Alpaca[^10], Vicuna[^11], and LIMA[^12]. These projects have employed LoRA[^24] to adapt the LLaMA[^25] model, an open-source LLM released by Meta in March 2023. Here's a brief overview of these projects:

- **Alpaca**: This initiative fine-tuned the 7B-parameter LLaMA model at a cost of less than $100. The process was completed in just 3 hours on eight 80GB A100s. Starting with 175 human-written instruction-output pairs from the [self-instruct seed set](https://\frac{github.com}{\frac{yizhongw}{self-instruct), the team expanded the dataset to include 52K unique records using OpenAI's `text-davinci-003` API, at a cost of less than $500.

- **Vicuna**: This project adapted the 13B-parameter LLaMA model using roughly 70K user-shared conversations collected from ShareGPT.com via public APIs. The training was conducted on eight A100 GPUs with 80GB memory, incurring a cost of approximately $300.

- **LIMA**: This initiative fine-tuned the largest variant of the LLaMA model, a 65B-parameter version, using 1000 carefully curated training examples. While Meta has not disclosed the associated training costs, they are likely to be substantial given the size of the model and the scale of the other projects.

While Meta restrict the use of LLaMA, the open-source community has risen to the occasion, developing freely available models like GPT4All-J[^13], Dolly v2[^14], and the high-performing Falcon[^26]. Falcon is a 40B-parameter model released under the Apache 2.0 license, has emerged as a particularly notable contender.

Efficient fine-tuning represents a valuable opportunity for organizations like ours. While we may not have the capacity to pre-train a model from scratch, we can still adapt existing models to excel in tasks specific to our domain. This approach not only aligns with our resource constraints, but it also encourages us to build our own dataset – a process that can result in a significant asset for our company.

### Enhance the Capability

In this section, we explore two key approaches that give language model the ability to call external APIs and retrieve additional information to augment their responses.

Firstly, we delve into the strategy of fine-tuning the model to enhance its data retrieval abilities. By leveraging tools such as calculators, web browsers, APIs, databases, and more, the model can be empowered to perform more sophisticated tasks during the inference stage.

Secondly, we explore the technique of structuring prompts in a manner that guides the model to follow a sequence of steps and produce outputs in specific data formats. This allows the calling function to take appropriate actions based on the model's output. A prominent framework that implements this strategy is Langchain, which we will discuss in detail later in this section.

#### Fine-tune with retrieval

WebGPT[^27] is a paper that OpenAI released at the end of 2021. They fine-tuned GPT-3 to answer long-form questions by using a text-based web browsing environment to retrieve relevant data, which allows the model to search and navigate the web.

The system is trained on a dataset of question-answer pairs using imitation learning, which involves recording the actions taken by humans to answer questions and using them as training data for the model. Human feedback is used to evaluate the accuracy and relevance of the final response generated by WebGPT, which is then used to adjust the parameters of both the main model and the reward model using reinforcement learning.

- ![](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/erictt/llm-tech-report/main/assets/report-69.png)
- The above illustration demonstrates how human operators prepare the training dataset. Initially, they select a question and input relevant keywords to conduct a search. Subsequently, they click on links and select paragraphs pertinent to the question. Once the search is completed, they click the `Done quoting` button to finalize the process.

During inference, WebGPT generates queries based on input questions and sends them to a simulated web browser using an automation library such as Playwright or Puppeteer. The browser returns relevant references that WebGPT uses to refine its initial answer, combining it with pre-trained knowledge.

- ![](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/erictt/llm-tech-report/main/assets/report-74.png)
- In this example, WebGPT initiates a search for "Joe Biden", clicks on a Wikipedia link, quotes a relevant paragraph, and uses that information to formulate an answer to the question. From the user's perspective, only the question and answer are visible, masking the underlying processes.

WebGPT extends the language model's knowledge beyond its training data, but it's not comprehensive enough for more complex tasks. Toolformer[^28] extends this approach by enabling the language model to use additional tools, such as calculators and simple API calls, enhancing problem-solving flexibility.

Here is an example of how Toolformer do inference:
![](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/erictt/llm-tech-report/main/assets/report-76.png)

So, how does Toolformer train the model to make use of available tools? Unlike WebGPT, which relies heavily on human involvement for generating training data and implementing reinforcement learning, Toolformer adopts a distinct strategy. It initially prompts GPT-3 to produce question-answer pairs based on a specific template. It then retains only the data where the answers are correct when compared to those generated without tool-related prompts (`[]`). Here is the prompt that Toolformer uses to generate training data:

- ![](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/erictt/llm-tech-report/main/assets/report-78.png)
The evaluation of Toolformer involved using a 6.7B parameter GPT-J model that was fine-tuned on a large number of sampled API calls. The results showed that Toolformer significantly improved the zero-shot performance of the GPT-J model on a range of downstream tasks, including LAMA and Math Benchmarks. In fact, Toolformer even outperformed the much larger GPT-3 model on these tasks. Furthermore, the gap between model predictions with and without API calls remained high even for larger models, indicating that Toolformer's performance improvement is not limited to smaller models.
- ![](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/erictt/llm-tech-report/main/assets/report-79.png)

Having the ability to call APIs are great, but we can't train the model to recognize the APIs every time we need to update the dataset and fine-tune the model again and again. Beside, the training is gonna be more expensive when we have massive APIs. Gorilla[^29] is fine-tuned using LLaMA-7B-based model with document retrieval using a specific dataset. The model is trained to understand the structure and content of API documentation, which enables it to generate accurate input arguments and reduce hallucination errors. Additionally, Gorilla's retrieval-aware training allows it to adapt to changes in API documentation.

During training with Gorilla, the instruction-tuned dataset is appended with an additional `"Use this API documentation for reference: <retrieved_API_doc_JSON>"` prompt that includes a JSON file of retrieved API documentation. This allows Gorilla to learn how to parse the second half of the question and answer the first half by retrieving relevant information from the API documentation. By doing so, Gorilla can adapt to changes in API documentation and improve its performance from in-context learning. Here are the example of the dataset that Gorilla uses for information retrieval trainning:

- ![](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/erictt/llm-tech-report/main/assets/report-81.png)
During inference, Gorilla retrieves the most up-to-date API documentation stored in the API Database using either BM25 or GPT-Index. The retrieved API documentation is then combined with the user prompt and a message that says `"Use this API documentation for reference:"`. This combined input is then fed to Gorilla, which uses the retrieved information from the API documentation to generate an accurate API call based on the input prompt. This process allows Gorilla to generate precise and reliable API calls that can be used to interact with various tools and services.

#### Prompt Engineering

We've discussed several methods of augmenting language models, with a primary focus on fine-tuning. The drawback of this method is the necessity for a comprehensive dataset, which might not always be readily available. Furthermore, some widely used models like GPT-4 and Claude don't support fine-tuning. Prompt engineering is gaining popularity as it doesn't modify the pre-trained model; instead, it enhances the model's capabilities by interacting with it through dynamic prompts. We briefly mentioned this technique in the last section that Gorilla dynamically incorporates API documentation into prompts, enabling the model to generate API call code based on these references. In this section, we will delve deeper into prompt engineering and discuss ways of enhancing language models without resorting to fine-tuning.

Prompt engineering predominantly employs three strategies: 1) augment model with documents; 2) enhancing the model with a chain of calls; and 3) enabling the model to utilize external tools such as web browser. Let's now dive deeper into each of these strategies, discuss the details.

**Augment model with documents

The power of a language model is somewhat constrained by its limited context window, which only allows it to inspect a few thousand words at a time. So how do we enhance the model's ability to answer questions based on the entirety of a given document? The answer lies in the effective use of **embeddings** and **vector databases**.

Embeddings are powerful tools that generate numerical representations of texts, effectively capturing their semantic meanings.

- ![](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/erictt/llm-tech-report/main/assets/report-82.png)

The beauty of embeddings is that their numerical similarity often corresponds to semantic similarity. For instance, the embedding vector of "canine companions say" is likely to be numerically closer to the vector of “woof” than to that of "meow."[^30]

- ![](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/erictt/llm-tech-report/main/assets/report-84.png)

Vector databases leverage a mix of algorithms that contribute to Approximate Nearest Neighbor (ANN) search, optimizing vector similarity searches through techniques like hashing, quantization, or graph-based search[^31]. Here is a common pipeline for a vector database:

![](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/erictt/llm-tech-report/main/assets/report-85.png)

In practical applications, documents are typically divided into smaller chunks to accommodate the language model's prompt size limitations. Each of these chunks is then assigned an embedding and stored in a vector database. The database's index becomes crucial in identifying the most pertinent chunks for any incoming query.

When a query is received, an embedding for it is created. This query embedding is then compared with all the vectors stored in the database. The most relevant chunks are selected based on this comparison.

Finally, both the query and the selected chunks are input into the prompt, resulting in the generation of a well-informed answer.

We will talk more about this strategy in the section of *Development of AI-powered Conversational Search* which discusses the first application we developed using these techniques.

**Enhance the model with chains**

At its core, chains involve using the output of one Language Learning Model (LLM) as the input for the subsequent chain (LLM). Below is an illustration of a simple sequential chain:

- ![](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/erictt/llm-tech-report/main/assets/report-88.png)
The developer's task is to effectively connect two chain calls by applying specific rules to format the data output from the first chain so we can pass it to the subsequent chain. Let's examine a more complex chain, the [Router Chains](https://python.langchain.com/en/latest/modules/chains/generic/router.html), to better understand this process. Router Chains are used to direct queries to different downstreams. Assume we have four different prompts corresponding to four subjects: physics, math, history, and computer science. We want the Language Learning Model (LLM) to act as an expert in each subject to answer relevant questions. In the first chain of Router Chains, the LLM determines the subject to which the question pertains. The following is an example of a router prompt template:

```
Given a raw text input to a language model select the model prompt best suited for the input. You will be given the names of the available prompts and a description of what the prompt is best suited for. You may also revise the original input if you think that revising it will ultimately lead to a better response from the language model.

<< FORMATTING >>
Return a markdown code snippet with a JSON object formatted to look like:
\`\`\`json
{{{{
    "destination": string \ name of the prompt to use or "DEFAULT"
    "next_inputs": string \ a potentially modified version of the original input
}}}}
\`\`\`

REMEMBER: "destination" MUST be one of the candidate prompt names specified below OR it can be "DEFAULT" if the input is not well suited for any of the candidate prompts.
REMEMBER: "next_inputs" can just be the original input if you don't think any modifications are needed.

<< CANDIDATE PROMPTS >>
physics:Good for answering questions about physics
math:Good for answering math questions
history:Good for answering history questions
computer science:Good for answering computer science questions

<< INPUT >>
{{input}}

<< OUTPUT (remember to include the ```json)>>
```

For a question like `what is 2 + 2`, the expected output would be a JSON object: `{destination: "math", next_inputs: "what is 2 + 2"}`. With this, we can then prompt the LLM with a revised query:

```
You are a very good mathematician. You are great at answering math questions. You are so good because you are able to break down hard problems into their component parts, answer the component parts, and then put them together to answer the broader question.

Here is a question:
what is 2 + 2
```

The key takeaway is that chains are a potent tool for extending the functionality of language models by breaking down the problem into several intermediate states. This way, the language model can concentrate on one simple task at a time.

**Leverage external tools**

External tools can also be utilized in conjunction with language models to enhance their capabilities. In these scenarios, the language model generates output in a JSON format, which is then used by the tools to perform specific actions. The results are then fed back to the language model for follow-up processing.

Consider an example where we have two tools, a calculator and a search tool (like Wikipedia), and we pose the question: `What is 25% of 300?`. Here is how Langchain makes sequential calls:

1. The language model is initially prompted to determine which tool to use. It is given a brief description of each tool and the format of the JSON blob to specify the tool and the input for the tool. Here is the prompt:

```
System: Answer the following questions as best you can. You have access to the following tools:

Calculator: Useful for when you need to answer questions about math.
Wikipedia: A wrapper around Wikipedia. Useful for when you need to answer general questions about people, places, companies, facts, historical events, or other subjects. Input should be a search query.

The way you use the tools is by specifying a json blob.
Specifically, this json should have a `action` key (with the name of the tool to use) and a `action_input` key (with the input to the tool going here).

The only values that should be in the \"action\" field are: Calculator, Wikipedia

The $JSON_BLOB should only contain a SINGLE action, do NOT return a list of multiple actions. Here is an example of a valid $JSON_BLOB:

\`\`\`
{
  \"action\": $TOOL_NAME,
  \"action_input\": $INPUT
}
\`\`\`

ALWAYS use the following format:

Question: the input question you must answer
Thought: you should always think about what to do
Action:
\`\`\`
$JSON_BLOB
\`\`\`
Observation: the result of the action
... (this Thought/Action/Observation can repeat N times)
Thought: I now know the final answer
Final Answer: the final answer to the original input question

Begin! Reminder to always use the exact characters `Final Answer` when responding.
Human: What is the 25% of 300?

```

2. The language model responds by determining that the question involves a mathematical calculation and accordingly selects the "Calculator" tool. It generates a JSON blob indicating the action to be performed by the tool:

```
Thought: We need to calculate 25% of 300, which involves multiplication and division.

Action:
\`\`\`
{
  \"action\": \"Calculator\",
  \"action_input\": \"300*0.25\"
}
\`\`\`

```

3. The Calculator tool is then used to perform the operation `300*0.25`, which results in the answer: 75.0.
4. The obtained result is then fed back to the language model. The language model is again presented with the original prompt, along with the previous thought process, the action taken, and the observation (result):

```
System: Answer the following questions as best you can. You have access to the following tools:

Calculator: Useful for when you need to answer questions about math.
Wikipedia: A wrapper around Wikipedia. Useful for when you need to answer general questions about people, places, companies, facts, historical events, or other subjects. Input should be a search query.

The way you use the tools is by specifying a json blob.
Specifically, this json should have a `action` key (with the name of the tool to use) and a `action_input` key (with the input to the tool going here).

The only values that should be in the \"action\" field are: Calculator, Wikipedia

The $JSON_BLOB should only contain a SINGLE action, do NOT return a list of multiple actions. Here is an example of a valid $JSON_BLOB:

\`\`\`
{
  \"action\": $TOOL_NAME,
  \"action_input\": $INPUT
}
\`\`\`

ALWAYS use the following format:

Question: the input question you must answer
Thought: you should always think about what to do
Action:
\`\`\`
$JSON_BLOB
\`\`\`
Observation: the result of the action
... (this Thought/Action/Observation can repeat N times)
Thought: I now know the final answer
Final Answer: the final answer to the original input question

Begin! Reminder to always use the exact characters `Final Answer` when responding.
Human: What is the 25% of 300?

This was your previous work (but I haven't seen any of it! I only see what you return as final answer):
Thought: We need to calculate 25% of 300, which involves multiplication and division.

Action:
\`\`\`
{
  \"action\": \"Calculator\",
  \"action_input\": \"300*0.25\"
}
\`\`\`


Observation: Answer: 75.0
Thought:

```

5. Finally, the language model formulates the final response by stating that it now has the answer to the question and provides the final answer: 75.0.

```
We have the answer to the question.
Final Answer: 75.0
```

For a deeper and more practical understanding of how to effectively use chains and agents, I highly recommend the short course offered by deeplearning.ai: [https://learn.deeplearning.ai/langchain/](https://learn.deeplearning.ai/langchain/). This course covers the main modules provided by Langchain and also provides detailed playbooks for hands-on experience.

## Model Evaluation

Evaluating the performance of AI models, especially language models, often involves the use of both automatically generated and manually curated test datasets. The language model itself can be a useful tool in creating these datasets. For instance, the model can be asked to produce a set of responses to specific prompts, which can then be used as part of the evaluation process.

Here's an example workflow:

1. **Test Dataset Generation**: Use the language model to generate a set of prompts and expected responses. This can be done by running a diverse set of prompts through the model and storing the model's responses as the 'expected' outcomes.

2. **Model Evaluation**: Once the test dataset is prepared, it can be used to evaluate the performance of the model. Run the same prompts through the model under evaluation and compare the responses with the 'expected' responses from the test dataset.

3. **Performance Metrics**: Use suitable metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, or F1 score to quantify the performance of the model. The choice of metrics will depend on the specific use-case and the nature of the responses.

4. **Iterative Improvement**: The results of the evaluation can provide valuable insights into the model's strengths and weaknesses, informing further development and refinement of the model.

Remember that ongoing monitoring and evaluation are vital. As the model's prompts and implementation strategies evolve over time, it's important to continually reassess the model's performance. This will ensure that any changes in performance, whether improvements or degradations, are promptly identified and addressed.

## Development of AI-powered Conversational Search

![](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/erictt/llm-tech-report/main/assets/report-62.png)

The first project our team embarked on is the AI-Powered Conversational Search - an advanced search tool designed to efficiently explore both our external and internal documents. Through conversational interactions, users can ask follow-up questions within the interface, enabling them to obtain more concise and relevant answers without the need to switch contexts. The goal of this project is to build a centralized search place for the Lightspeeders and potentially expend it to encompass our customers, providing them with a comprehensive and user-friendly search experience.

Here is the general infrastructure:

- ![](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/erictt/llm-tech-report/main/assets/report-63.png)
As an MVP(Minimum Viable Product), we have prioritized simplicity in our approach. Currently, our system supports the ingestion of documents from two primary sources: Github and the webpages from the help center. The integration process for projects within these categories is straightforward and requires minimal configuration. This allows us to easily expand our search capabilities and provide comprehensive document retrieval for a wide range of projects falling under these categories.

**Components**:

- Ingestion (Github and Webpage from help center)
  - For Github, we have registered webhooks that trigger updates in our database whenever any changes are made to the associated documentation.
  - As for webpages, we rely on external calls to notify our system about any modifications, allowing it to react accordingly.
- Make Chain:
  - ![](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/erictt/llm-tech-report/main/assets/report-64.png)
  - This key component acts as the interface between our system and the LLM (OpenAI's API). Utilizing the conversational approach, it follows a two-step process. Firstly, it constructs a standalone question by incorporating the entire conversation. Then, it sends a subsequent request with the standalone question and relevant context gathered from the vector DB.
- VectorStore:
  - ![](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/erictt/llm-tech-report/main/assets/report-65.png)
  - This component is responsible for managing document data, including tasks such as document segmentation into chunks, creating embeddings for efficient processing, and facilitating interactions with the database. It plays a vital role in organizing and optimizing document-related information within the system.

### Addressing Challenges and Problems

During the collaboration with the Analytics team, we have tracked down lots of problems when applying the LLMs into our search. Here are a few interesting ones:

- **The "burger" dilemma:** When asking a completely different follow-up question, the system just simply ignore it, and repeat the answer to the first question.
  - ![](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/erictt/llm-tech-report/main/assets/report-66.png)
  - This issue is rooted in our current question + answer strategy. For instance, when the follow-up question "What is a burger?" is asked, the system rebuilds the question, incorporating the history of the conversation, including the answer. As a result, the question that OpenAI receives is the initial query, "Can you explain how to create a report from analytics to view trailing sales?"
  - A potential solution involves adopting a different strategy for integrating the conversation. Rather than compressing the entire conversation to form a standalone question, we could leverage LLMs to summarize the previous conversation while leaving the new question untouched. We would then send both the summary and the new question to OpenAI's API.

- **The made-up answer Issue**. When GPT-3.5-turbo lacks adequate context, it tends to invent answers, even when explicitly instructed to rely solely on the provided context.
  - For instance, in the following example, GPT-3.5-turbo incorrectly interprets the "By Shop" variation as a report.
  - ![](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/erictt/llm-tech-report/main/assets/report-67.png)
  - This problem suggests two possible solutions:
  1. Develop more accessible documentation for LLMs to better comprehend.
  2. Consider upgrading to GPT-4, which reportedly performs superiorly to GPT-3.5-turbo.

It's important to note that developing an application with LLM is not as simple as plug-and-play. Even with advanced models like GPT-4, it's not a magic solution that resolves everything automatically. In reality, it requires significant effort to ensure that the model functions as anticipated.

## Future Opportunities with LLMs and  Beyond

- Customer service chatbot.
  - LLM naturally fits into the category of chatbot. It allows us to provide our customers with personalized and accurate responses. With an enhanced search tool, our chatbot can quickly retrieve information from our knowledge base, ensuring that customers receive customized answers and support 24/7.
  - It can saves our agents valuable time, enabling them to focus on more complex customer inquiries and ultimately improving overall efficiency and customer satisfaction.
- Analyze customer feedback or reviews.
  - With traditional programming, we might have predefined keywords or phrases to look for in customer feedback to predict churn. However, this approach could miss nuances in the language that are indicative of customer satisfaction or dissatisfaction. With LLM, we can easily extract the information easily without writing complicated program.
- Content generation.
  - LLMs can generate high-quality text across different domains, including creative writing, and technical writing. For instance, we can use LLMs to generate product descriptions with specific requirements from our customers. And furthermore, use photos to generate the entire product page, including the title, keywords and description.
    <!--
	- // TODO use mini-GPT4 to analyze a product photo and use it to generate a product description.

- TBC

## Conclusion

In the dynamic landscape of AI, new advancements and innovations continually emerge. Despite the proficiency of advanced models like GPT-4, they still have limitations that smaller, fine-tuned models can address more cost-effectively and quickly. Many projects have effectively harnessed language models while simultaneously extending their capabilities through prompt engineering, such as Langchain[^32] and Auto-GPT[^33]. These developments present abundant opportunities for small companies to create domain-specific applications that broad-purpose models cannot address.

Reflecting on the progress we've made, the value of our AI-powered document search project is clear. It represents a significant leap forward in harnessing the power of large language models for practical, everyday tasks. However, this is only the beginning. We are standing at the precipice of a new era of AI and our work, we hope this project will inspire more teams to join us in this exciting journey.

  - It's an AI-powered task management system. The system uses OpenAI and vector databases such as Chroma or Weaviate to create, prioritize, and execute tasks. The main idea behind this system is that it creates tasks based on the result of previous tasks and a predefined objective. Here is how it works:

  - A experiment that accompanies the paper entitled "Generative Agents: Interactive Simulacra of Human Behavior."[^34]
  - In the experiment, the virtual village was operated for two days to observe the interactions and behaviors of the AI villagers. The village consisted of 25 villagers, each with a unique character setup. For example, one of the villagers named Isabella, who runs a coffee shop, planned to host a Valentine's Day event at her café.
