# [Draft]Technical Report: LLM and Its Potential in Lightspeed

Written by Eric Yang, with the help of ChatGPT and Perplexity.ai

## Introduction

Artificial Intelligence (AI) has become an increasingly hot topic since the release of ChatGPT by OpenAI, inspiring numerous projects built using OpenAI's APIs without the need for deploying independent language models. The advent of Large Language Models (LLMs) is set to revolutionize a multitude of sectors, from technology to healthcare, and from education to entertainment. We believe that embracing this innovation, and integrating it into our products will not only offer invaluable features to our customers, but also elevate us to a leading position among our competitors.

As the Pipe Jumpers team, we have taken the initiative to explore the potentialities of LLMs and their transformative power within various areas. Over the course of two months, we have dedicated our efforts to research, experimentation, and the creation of [a proof-of-concept demo](https://poc-common-ai.lightspeedsbx.app/) that demonstrates the capabilities of LLMs. Our most recent endeavour focuses on the [AI-powered conversational search](https://ai-search.lightspeedsbx.app/analytics) project, in collaboration with our analytics team, which has successfully progressed to its alpha phase. Notably, even at this early stage, it has already yielded impressive results.

This report aims to provide a high-level understanding of AI and LLMs, and their implications for product development. We begin with an introduction of AI, followed by an in-depth analysis of the technology that drives LLM-based products. We then focus on our AI-powered conversational search system, examining its functionality, the challenges we faced, and potential enhancements. Finally, we'll illuminate the opportunities that LLMs present for Lightspeed to explore and leverage.

## The Fundamentals of AI in LLM-Driven Products

>"It seems probable that once the machine thinking method had started, it would not take long to outstrip our feeble powers. ... At some stage therefore we should have to expect the machines to take control." - Alan Turing, 1951

Artificial intelligence (AI) is a branch of computer science that aims to create systems capable of performing tasks that normally require human intelligence, such as understanding natural language, recognizing patterns, make decisions. It began in 1950 with Alan Turing's proposal of the Turing Test, a measurement to determine if a computer can demonstrate the same intelligence as a human.[^1]

Machine Learning (ML) is a subset of AI that employs statistical learning and optimization techniques to enable computers to analyze data, identify patterns, and make predictions or decisions. A typical ML algorithm comprises a *decision process* that guesses patterns in the data, an *error function* to measure the accuracy of these guesses against known examples, and an *updating process* that refines the decision-making to improve future predictions.[^2]

To illustrate the difference between traditional programming and ML, imagine we are trying to predict customer churn for an online store. With traditional programming, we might create rules based on observed patterns, such as predicting that a customer will churn if they haven't made a purchase in six months. This rule-based system is easy to understand and implement but is limited by the complexity of human behavior.

On the other hand, an ML approach would involve providing a model with numerous examples of customers who have and haven't churned, along with relevant details about each customer (e.g., purchase frequency, product preferences, feedback). The ML model learns the characteristics associated with customer churn directly from the data, which allows it to consider a broader range of factors than a simple rule-based system.

Deep Learning (DL) is an advanced form of ML that can handle more complex patterns and automatically determine which features are important. With DL, we can feed the model raw data, such as the full purchase history of each customer. The model then learns which characteristics are indicative of churn and which aspects of the data are most important to consider. This advanced method can lead to more accurate predictions, but it requires more data and computational resources to train.

Returning to our churn prediction example. With DL, instead of providing the model with preselected customer details, we could input a customer's full purchase history. The DL model can then analyze this raw data, learning to recognize intricate patterns and important features that indicate customer churn. While more complex, this approach allows for a nuanced understanding of customer behavior, potentially leading to more accurate churn predictions.

### Natural Language Processing (NLP) and Language Model(LM)

NLP is a field of AI that focuses on the interaction between computers and human language. It involves enabling computers to understand, interpret, and generate human language in a valuable way. Here are some NLP problems that we want computers to solve:

![](report-3.png)

A language model is a probability distribution over sequences of words.[^3] It is trained on vast amounts of text data and learns the statistical patterns and relationships between words and phrases. It can generate human-like text by predicting the likelihood of a given sequence of words appearing in a text. More advanced LMs, such as GPT-4[^4], are even capable of generating contextually relevant sentences and carrying out tasks that require a deep understanding of the text and image.

#### The Transformer Era

![](report-7.png)

In 2017, the game-changing paper "Attention Is All You Need"[^5] was published, introducing a new neural network architecture called the Transformer. This architecture was originally designed to improve machine translation and has since become the cornerstone of many Large Language Models (LLM has no formal definition, it often refers to the models having billions or more parameters[^6]). The Transformer architecture allowed for the development of models like BERT[^7] and GPT[^8], which have had a significant impact on the field. These models demonstrated that Transformers could be used to understand the context of words and sentences in a way that previous models could not. Nowadays, the Transformer architecture is a standard component in the design of most LLMs, powering a wide range of applications in natural language processing.

Transformer: https://medium.com/geekculture/transformers-231c4a430746

What is Transformer architecture? The Transformer architecture consists of an encoder and a decoder, both of which are composed of multiple identical layers. Each layer has two sub-layers: a multi-head self-attention mechanism, and a simple position-wise fully connected feed-forward network.

Let's break down these components:
1.  **Multi-head self-attention mechanism**: This is what allows the model to focus on different parts of the input sequence when producing an output. Each "attention head" computes a weighted sum of all input elements, where the weights are determined by the compatibility of the input elements with the query. The 'self' in 'self-attention' refers to the fact that the queries, keys, and values are all the same: the input elements themselves. The outputs of all attention heads are then concatenated and linearly transformed to result in the final output of the multi-head self-attention.
2.  **Position-wise fully connected feed-forward network**: This is essentially a two-layer neural network that's applied identically to each position, allowing the network to transform the attended features independently at each position.
3.  **Residual connections and layer normalization**: To help training, each sub-layer (i.e., multi-head self-attention and position-wise feed-forward) in the encoder and decoder has a residual connection around it followed by layer normalization.
4.  **Positional encoding**: Since the self-attention mechanism doesn't have any inherent notion of the position of elements in the sequence, positional encoding is added to the input embeddings to give the model some information about the relative or absolute position of the elements in the sequence.

Let's consider an example to understand how a Transformer neuron works:

Imagine we're translating a sentence from English to French. The input to the encoder is the sequence of English words, and each word is represented by an embedding vector. The self-attention mechanism in the encoder allows each word to 'attend' to all other words in the sentence, i.e., the representation of each word is influenced by all other words, not just the preceding ones as in RNNs or LSTMs. For instance, in the sentence "The cat, which already ate a fish, is full", the word 'is' can directly attend to 'cat', even though they're far apart in the sentence.

The encoder produces a sequence of vectors, which is then passed to the decoder. The decoder also has a self-attention mechanism, allowing it to attend to all words in the output sentence it has generated so far. However, to prevent it from 'cheating' by attending to future words, a 'mask' is applied to the attention weights.

The decoder also has a second multi-head attention mechanism that lets it attend to the encoder's output, allowing each word in the output sentence to be influenced by all words in the input sentence. The final output of the decoder is a probability distribution over the French vocabulary, from which the word with the highest probability is selected.

Through this process, Transformers capture intricate relationships between words in a sentence, making them effective for tasks like translation, summarization, question-answering, and many others.

Prior to the Transformers, recurrent neural networks (RNNs) served as the predominant approach. Although an increasing number of researchers have joined the ranks of the transformer team, there remain certain groups dedicated to enhancing RNNs. Notably, a recent project named The RWKV Language Model[^9], a novel and refined model that leverages the advantageous features of transformers to augment RNN performance.

GPT-4 by OpenAI remains the top-performing model in the market, and it appears set to maintain this position for some time. However, the AI landscape is highly dynamic, with newcomers like Google's PaLM 2 already showing promising results and being integrated into various Google products[^10].

While these high-performing models grab the headlines, there is a vibrant and innovative open-source community contributing to the advancement of LLMs. The community is making significant strides, as highlighted by the work on Alpaca[^11], Vicuna[^12].

The success of these projects underscores the truth in the phrase "less is more," a concept brilliantly demonstrated in the paper "Less Is More for Alignment"[^13] These models have shown that the quality of training data often outweighs the quantity. For instance, LIMA was trained on just 1000 examples(details below) using the LLaMA 65B model[^13] but managed to outperform Alpaca, which was trained with 52K instructing-following examples[^11].
- ![](report-10.png)
	- Source: LIMA: Less Is More for Alignment[^13]

This revelation provides a valuable insight for the development of future large language models: a customized, high-quality dataset may be more beneficial than simply having a large volume of data. The impressive performance of models like Alpaca, Vicuna, and LIMA is a testament to this.

GPT4All-J[^14] and Dolly[^15], despite being the least performing models, are noteworthy for providing access to LLMs under the Apache 2.0 license, making them accessible in commercial use. Despite their current performance limitations, there is potential in these models as foundational technologies for future advancements in the AI field. Additionally, RedPajama released a dataset consisting of 1.2 trillion tokens[^16], bringing further improvement within reach.

## Augmented LM

Why do we need to augment language models? While LLMs are adept at basic reasoning, code interpretation, and following instructions, they often lack knowledge, particularly current information and domain-specific knowledge. One way to enhance this is by enriching the context with more data, enabling the model to answer questions based on this context. This is known as in-context learning or few-shot learning[^16][^17].  Here is an example of prompt[^18] :
```
It takes Amy 4 minutes to climb to the top of a slide. It takes her 1 minute to slide down. The slide closes in 15 minutes.

Subquestion 1: How long does each trip take?
Answer 1: It takes Amy 4 minutes to climb and 1 minute to slide down. 4 + 1 = 5. So each trip takes 5 minutes.

Subquestion 2: How many times can she slide before it closes?
<LM>
Answer 2: The water slide closes in 15 minutes. Each trip takes 5 minutes. So Amy can slide 15 ÷ 5 = 3 times before it closes.
</LM>
```
- `<LM></LM>` denotes the start and the end of the LM's output.

The context window size has seen a considerable increase recently, with GPT-4 supporting up to 32K tokens and Claude handling even up to 100K tokens. This means we can fit the content equivalent to a short novel into the context. However, the problem of a limited context window persists. Firstly, it's not feasible to fit infinite content into the prompt like we can with a database. Secondly, AI companies charge by the token count, implying that a larger context results in a higher cost. Thus, it's crucial for us to find a cost-efficient method. The key challenge we aim to address is how to augment the language model within a limited context.

In the following, we will look at two methods that being widely used for augmenting LMs:  *data retrieval* and *chains of thought*.

// TODO

<!--
**Data Retrieval**

Consider we're building a document search tool, and our prompt looks like this: 
```
You are a friendly agent. Answer the question based on given context.

[CONTEXT SECTIONS]

[QUESTION]
{question}

[ANSWER]
```

The `{context}` should be a search result based on the `{question}`.

## Development of AI-powered Conversational Search

![](report-16.png)


AI-powered Conversational Search is an advanced search tool designed to efficiently explore both our external and internal documents. Through conversational interactions, users can ask follow-up questions within the interface, enabling them to obtain more concise and relevant answers without the need to switch contexts. The goal of this project is to build a centralized search place for the Lightspeeders and potentially expend it to encompass our customers, providing them with a comprehensive and user-friendly search experience.

Here is the general infrastructure:
- ![](report-17.png)
As an MVP (Minimum Viable Product), we have prioritized simplicity in our approach. Currently, our system supports the ingestion of documents from two primary sources: Github and the webpages from the help center. The integration process for projects within these categories is straightforward and requires minimal configuration. This allows us to easily expand our search capabilities and provide comprehensive document retrieval for a wide range of projects falling under these categories.

**Components**:

- Ingestion (Github and Webpage from help center)
	- For Github, we have registered webhooks that trigger updates in our database whenever any changes are made to the associated documentation.
	- As for webpages, we rely on external calls to notify our system about any modifications, allowing it to react accordingly.
- Make Chain:
	- ![](report-15.png)
	- This key component acts as the interface between our system and the LLM (OpenAI's API). Utilizing the conversational approach, it follows a two-step process. Firstly, it constructs a standalone question by incorporating the entire conversation. Then, it sends a subsequent request with the standalone question and relevant context gathered from the vector DB.
- VectorStore:
	- ![](report-18.png)
	- This component is responsible for managing document data, including tasks such as document segmentation into chunks, creating embeddings for efficient processing, and facilitating interactions with the database. It plays a vital role in organizing and optimizing document-related information within the system.

### Addressing Challenges and Problems

During the collabration with the Analytics team, we have tracked down lots of problems when applying the LLMs into our search. Here are a few interesting ones:

- **The "burger" dilemma:** When asking a completely different follow-up question, the system just simply ignore it, and repeat the answer to the first question. 
	- ![](report-11.png)
	- This issue is rooted in our current question + answer strategy. For instance, when the follow-up question "What is a burger?" is asked, the system rebuilds the question, incorporating the history of the conversation, including the answer. As a result, the question that OpenAI receives is the initial query, "Can you explain how to create a report from analytics to view trailing sales?"
	- A potential solution involves adopting a different strategy for integrating the conversation. Rather than compressing the entire conversation to form a standalone question, we could leverage LLMs to summarize the previous conversation while leaving the new question untouched. We would then send both the summary and the new question to OpenAI's API.

- **The made-up answer Issue**. When GPT-3.5-turbo lacks adequate context, it tends to invent answers, even when explicitly instructed to rely solely on the provided context.
	- For instance, in the following example, GPT-3.5-turbo incorrectly interprets the "By Shop" variation as a report.
	- ![](report-13.png)
	- This problem suggests two possible solutions:
		1. Develop more accessible documentation for LLMs to better comprehend.
		2. Consider upgrading to GPT-4, which reportedly performs superiorly to GPT-3.5-turbo.

## Future Opportunities with LLMs and  Beyond

- Customer service chatbot.
	- LLM natually fits into the category of chatbot. It allows us to provide our customers with personalized and accurate responses. With an enhanced search tool, our chatbot can quickly retrieve information from our knowledge base, ensuring that customers receive customized answers and support 24/7. 
	- It can saves our agents valuable time, enabling them to focus on more complex customer inquiries and ultimately improving overall efficiency and customer satisfaction.
- Analyze customer feedback or reviews. 
	- With traditional programming, we might have predefined keywords or phrases to look for in customer feedback to predict churn. However, this approach could miss nuances in the language that are indicative of customer satisfaction or dissatisfaction. With LLM, we can easily extract the information easily without wrting complicated program.
- Content generation.
	- LLMs can generate high-quality text across different domains, including creative writing, and technical writing. For instance, we can use LLMs to generate product descriptions with specific requirements from our customers. And furthermore, use photos to generate the entire product page, including the title, keywords and description.
	- // TODO use mini-GPT4 to analyze a product photo and use it to generate a product description.

## Conclusion

In the rapidly evolving world of AI, new projects and innovations are emerging every day. While many of these initiatives are still in their early stages, such as Langchain[^19], Auto-GPT[^20], they hold immense potential for growth and development. As we navigate this dynamic landscape, we also need to prepare us for the tide.

One key aspect of our readiness lies in our ability to gather and maintain a robust dataset. The value of high-quality data for training cannot be overstated – it is an investment for the future, essential to a variety of tasks and challenges that we anticipate. As we continue our journey in AI, accumulating and refining our dataset is a priority.

Reflecting on the progress we've made, the value of our AI-powered document search project is clear. It represents a significant leap forward in harnessing the power of large language models for practical, everyday tasks. However, this is only the beginning. We are standing at the precipice of a new era of AI and our work, we hope this project will inspire more teams to join us in this exciting journey.

	- A experiment that accompanies the paper entitled "Generative Agents: Interactive Simulacra of Human Behavior."[^18]
	- In the experiment, the virtual village was operated for two days to observe the interactions and behaviors of the AI villagers. The village consisted of 25 villagers, each with a unique character setup. For example, one of the villagers named Isabella, who runs a coffee shop, planned to host a Valentine's Day event at her café.
